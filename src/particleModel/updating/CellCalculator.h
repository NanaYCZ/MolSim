     * of cells around a cell depending on the cell size. That amount is determent with the
     * "comparing_depth" attribute, which is the amount of layers we are comparing around each cell.
     * Now instead of iterating through all of the cells within the cutoff radius for each cell directly,
     * we are covering them by iterating over so called "paths" created with a starting position and a
     * shifting pattern that shows which cells should be calculated next.
     * This way we are calculating all the forces within the cutoff radius for each cell, through divide
     * and conquer with "paths" that are non overlapping for each pattern, which allows parallelization
     * without using locks, with the hope of improving performance.
     *
     * OpenMP: since all the "paths" are discrete for each "pattern", we can safely apply parallelization
     * for all starting points, which is dynamic because of varying "path" lengths
     *
     * we delegated the periodic force calculation, because the mirroring resulted in overlapping of the "paths"
